To add a new widget:

  gml/elements: add a new class. fix Make.mm
    This is easy. Just use Button.py as a template and
    replace button by the name of new widget

  gml/parser: add a new class. fix Make.mm
    This is not difficult. If the new elment is not a element
    container like button, use Button.y as a template.
    If the new element can contain other elements, like
    panel and dialog, use Dialog.py as template.

    Also goto to each widget that can contain
    this new widget, add on<widgetname> methods.
    For example if new widget is TextField, 
    and method onTextField to widgets that can
    contain TextField.

  gml/parser/Document.py: add class name
    Just add the name of the new widget to the list.
  
  in every toolkits, implement a new class.
    - gml/wx. fix Make.mm, __init__.py
      This is more difficult to explain.

  add a new method to renderer classes
    - gml/WxRenderers



FAQ:

 Q.  why I got this error:
      AttributeError: 'Sizer' object has no attribute 'onPanel'
 A.  The gml/parser/Sizer does not allow it to contain a Panel.
     Add "onPanel" method to Sizer class.
